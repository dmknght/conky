# conky
Advanced conky, based on black perl conky, focuses on system monitoring.
I tried my best to bring system information as much as i can to conky's panel. 
Setup:
1. Copy all file in folder conky to /etc/conky/
2. add exec permission to startup.sh, edit conky in 'startup applications' to /etc/conky/startup.sh
3. Install font in Future folder
Requires cairo for lua script
Special thanks to author of Black perl conky
Known bug: connection panel disappeared or displayed wrong way when networking chagned to no connection
